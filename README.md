# Fractol

This is my first graphical project. It introduces window management, event handling, images and colours.  
The point of the project is to display [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal), in particular the mandelbrot and julia sets on a window.

## Functionality

The program displays fractals on the screen with several added features that allow changing the image in the window.  
You can switch between the fractals by using the numbers on your keyboard.  
You can increase the amount of iterations that are used for rendering the fractals (make the fractals sharper, but takes more time to render).  
You can move the imgae on the window by using the arrow keys or WASD.  
You can zoom in on the image by using the mouse.  
You can adjust the separate streams of the colour used for displaying the fractal.

## Usage

Clone the project and run 'make' in the repository.  
Once compiled run the program with the name of the fractal as the argument. You can just run the program for instructions on how to use it.  
When the window opens it will have instructions on how to use the program.
